Description: Arabic or acacia gum is the dried exudate obtained from the stems and branches
of Acacia Senegal (L.) willd. or of related species of Acacia. Injured trees exude gum Arabic;
heat, poor nutrition and drought stimulate its production. Most of the gum Arabic production
is from wild trees, but some from privately owned and cultivated gardens are tapped and col-
lected on a systematic basis.

The gum called Hashab geneina (garden gum) is the cleanest and lightest grade and
is most preferred for the US. market. The wild gum (called Hashab wady) is collected on a part-
time basis in the dry season, from October to May or June, by natives whose main occupation is
usually farming. After gathering, it is taken to central collecting stations where it is auctioned
under government supervision, graded by hand and dried before exporting to gum suppliers in all
parts of the world. Then it is resorted, ground, processed and graded to various speciﬁcations.

Clear, white (sun-bleached) spheroidal tears, up to 32 mm in diameter, also occur
as ﬂakes. Chemically, gum Arabic is a neutral or slightly acid salt of a complex polysaccha-
ride containing calcium, magnesium and potassium cations. Its most distinguishing property
among the natural gums is its extreme solubility in water. Solutions of over 50% concentra-
tion may be prepared. Gum Arabic is best described as "heteropolymolecular," that is, a poly-
mer system having either a variation in monomer (galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, glucuronic
acid and 4-0-methy1gucuronic acid) composition and/or variation in the mode of linking and
branching of the monomer units, in addition to a distribution in molecular weight.

Major uses of gum Arabic in foods are as a ﬁxative for ﬂavors, a foam stabilizer
in beverages, an adhesive for icings and toppings, and an emulsiﬁer and stabilizer in confec-
tionary and ice cream. It is also widely used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, paper, textile,
paint, ink and lithography industries.

Synthesis: The method of synthesis is dependent on the price of feedstock and may be pro-
duced by a number of methods: (1) by oxidation of ethyl alcohol with potassium dichromate
or manganese dioxide in the presence of sulfuric acid; (2) by addition of water to acetylene;
(3) by formation during the natural alcoholic fermentation process. Recovery is effected by
suitable fractionation, subsequent preparation of the acetaldehyde ammonia and ﬁnal treat-
ment of the addition compound with diluted sulfuric acid.

C013 No.: 2 EINECS No.: 200-580-7 JECFA No.: 81

Description: Acetic acid, CH3COOl-I, is a colorless, volatile liquid at ambient temperatures.
The pure compound, glacial acetic acid, owes its name to its ice-like crystalline appearance at
156°C. As generally supplied, acetic acid is a 6 N aqueous solution (about 36%) or a l N
solution (about 6%). These or other dilutions are used in adding appropriate amounts of ace-
tic acid to foods. Acetic acid is the characteristic acid of vinegar, its concentration ranging
from 3.5 to 5.6%. Acetic acid and acetates are present in most plants and animal tissues in
small but detectable amounts. They are normal metabolic intermediates, are produced by
such bacterial species as Acetobacter and can be synthesized completely from carbon dioxide

by such microorganisms as C lostridium thermoaceticum. The rat forms acetate at the rate of
1% of its body weight per day.

As a colorless liquid with a strong, pungent, characteristic vinegar odor, it is use-
ful in butter, cheese, grape and fruit ﬂavors. Very little pure acetic acid as such is used in
foods, although it is classiﬁed by FDA as a GRAS material. Consequently, it may be
employed in products that are not covered by Deﬁnitions and Standards of Identity. Acetic
acid is the principal component of Vinegars and pyroligneous acid. In the form of vinegar,
more than 27 million lb were added to food in 1986, with approximately equal amounts used
as acidulants and ﬂavoring agents. In fact, acetic acid (as vinegar) was one of the earliest ﬂa-
voring agents. Vinegars are used extensively in preparing salad dressing and mayonnaise,
sour and sweet pickles and numerous sauces and catsups. They are also used in the curing of
meat and in the canning of certain vegetables. In the manufacture of mayonnaise, the addition
of a portion of acetic acid (vinegar) to the salt- or sugar-yolk reduces the heat resistance of
Salmonella. Water binding compositions of sausages often include acetic acid or its sodium
salt, while calcium acetate is used to preserve the texture of sliced, canned vegetables.

number of different processes. As dilute solutions, it is obtained from alcohol by the “Quick-
Vmegar Process.” Smaller quantities are obtained from the pyroligneous acid liquors
acquired in the destructive distillation of hard wood. It is manufactured synthetically in high
yields by the oxidation of acetaldehyde and of butane, and as the reaction product of metha-
nol and carbon monoxide.

Vinegars are produced from cider, grapes (or wine), sucrose, glucose or malt by
successive alcoholic and acetous fermentations. In the US. the use of the term “vinegar,”
without qualifying adjectives, implies only cider vinegar. Although a 4 to 8% solution of pure
acetic acid would have the same taste characteristics as cider vinegar, it could not qualify as a
vinegar, since it would lack other readily detectable components characteristic of cider vine-
gar. In Great Britain, malt vinegar is speciﬁed. On the European continent, wine vinegar is
the most common variety.

CoE No.: 33 EINECS No.: 207-877-0 JECFA No.: n/a 1'

Description: Aconitic acid has a very low odor (if any) and a winy-sour taste. It is used in
hit ﬂavors, rum and brandy. Aconitic acid is also commonly known as 1,2,3-propenetri car-
boxylic acid and occurs in the leaves of tubers of Aconitum napellus L. and other Ranuncu-
laceae. It is also found in yarrow (Achillea spp.) and horsetails (Equisetum spp.), as well as in
other plants such as beets and sugarcane. Depending on the natural source, aconitic acid is
also called achilleic acid, citridic acid or equisetic acid.

Aconitic acid of the trans-conﬁguration can be isolated during the processing of
sugarcane, by precipitating it as the calcium salt from cane syrup or molasses. The concentra-
tion in molasses ranges from 1.8 to 2.5%. Aconitic acid may be synthesized from citric acid
by dehydration with sulfuric acid, or by catalytic dehydration. The cis—conﬁguration is some-
what unstable and is readily rearranged to the trans form by heating. Trans-aconitic acid is
decarboxylated to itaconic acid by heating to 180°F. The cis form occurs in plant and animal
tissues as a metabolic intermediate in the Krebs cycle during the isomerization of citric acid
to isocitric acid by the action of enzyme aconitase.

Description: Adipic acid is a crystalline powder with practically no odor. It has the lowest
acidity of any of the acids commonly used in foods and has excellent buffering capacity in the
range of pH 2.5 to 3.0. Like succinic and fuman'c acid, adipic acid is practically non-hygro-
scopic. Its addition to foods imparts a smooth, tart taste. In grape-ﬂavored products, it adds a
lingering supplementary ﬂavor and gives an excellent set to food powders containing gelatin.
As a result, adipic acid has found a wide number of uses as an accidulant in dry powdered
food mixtures, especially in those products having delicate ﬂavors and where addition of tang
to the ﬂavor is undesirable.

Its aqueous solutions have the lowest acidity of any of the common food acids.
For concentrations from 0.5 to 2.4 g/ 100 ml, the pH of its solution varies less than half a unit.
Hence, it can be used as a buﬂ‘ering agent to maintain acidities within the range of 2.5 to 3.0.

This is highly desirable in certain foods, yet the pH is low enough to inhibit the browning of
most fruits and other foodstuffs.

Description: A dried hydrophilic, colloidal polygalactoside derived from the entire plant
(minus the roots) of Gelidium cartilagineum (L.) Gaillon or Gracilaria confervoides (L.)
Greville. It is commercially available in bundles consisting of thin, membranous agglutinated
strips or in cut, ﬂaked granulated or powdered form. Although agar was discovered in Japan
in 1658, it was introduced to Europe and the US. from China in the nineteenth century,
where it was initially used as a gelatin substitute in the making of desserts. It soon became
widely used as a solid bacteriological culture medium after its use by Robert Koch in his
famous experiments. Its major uses in the food industry of today are in bakery products, con-
fectionary, dairy products and canned meat and ﬁsh. It is also used in microbiology, dentistry
and medicine.

The Gelidium species amansii and cartilageneum are the major sources of agar,
although many species of Rhodophyceae are used. The weeds (agarophytes) used in the
commercial product of agar grow from the tide line out to depths of 120 ft, and are harvested
by waders along the shore at low tide, raked from small boats or picked by divers. Japan is
the largest producer of agar. Because agar is soluble in hot water but relatively insoluble in
cold water, it is extracted by boiling the agarophyte in water, ﬁltering, cooling to form a gel,
cutting into pieces and frozen, then thawing to free the agar from salts and other impurities
that are soluble in cold water. The wet agar is repeatedly washed with cold water and ﬁnally
dried. American and Japanese agar are graded according to published speciﬁcations. The
high-quality American agar is divided into bacteriological, medicinal and dental grades; and
the Japanese agar, into three grades and two subgrades. It is odorless or with a slight charac-
teristic odor and mucilaginous taste. The structure of agar is not completely known. Chemi-
cally, agar is believed to be composed of 3,6-anhydro-L-glactose and D-galactopyranose
residues in varying proportions.

Description: This is a secondary amino acid, which is formed in vivo by the degradation of
dihydrouracil and camosine. Because neuronal uptake and neuronal receptor sensitivity to B-
alanine have been demonstrated, the compound may be a false transmitter replacing GABA.
A rare genetic disorder, hyper-B—alaninemia, has been reported. It is used as a ﬂavor
enhancer, ﬂavoring agent, nutrient supplement or adjuvant. B-Alanine has a slightly sweet
taste.

Flavor Ingredients 65

Description: Bitter almond has an intense, almond-like, cherry aroma with a slightly astrin-
gent. moldy taste. The term bitter almond refers to the essential oil obtained by steam distilla-
tion of the partially de-oleated press-cake of kernels from any of the following: bitter almond
(P. amygdalus). apricot (P. armeniaca) and peach (P. persica). The kernels from these and
other such fruits contain the glucoside amygdalin. which on enzymatic hydrolysis yields ben-
zaldehyde and HCN. The distilled oil must be rendered free of HCN (prussic acid) prior to its
marketing as a ﬂavor ingredient. Very little essential oil is currently made exclusively from
bitter almonds or other fruit kernels; specially puriﬁed benzaldehyde is often used in its
place.

Physical—chemical characteristics: Oil intended for use as a ﬂavor ingredient is treated to
remove traces of HCN by precipitation as insoluble calcium ferrocyanide.

Essential oil composition: Bitter-almond oil is obtained by ﬁrst cold-expressing the ﬁxed
oils from the comminuted kernels. after which the press-cake is macerated in about 10 parts
of water for 12 to 20 hours to effect the enzymatic hydrolysis of amygdalin. The mixture is
then steam distilled to yield about 0.5 to 0.7% of the essential oil. Bitter almonds are rarely
used because the yield of oil is only 0.6%. Apricot kernels yield 1.2% of oil and are the pre-
ferred starting material. The major components of the oil are typically 97.5% benzaldehyde
(bitter almond) and 2% hydrogen cyanide (bitter almond).

Botanical family: Liliaceae

Other names: Aloe ext.; Aloe, extract (Aloe spp.)

Foreign names: Aloes (Fr.), Aloe (Gr.), Aloe (Sp.), Aloe (lt.)

C013 No.: n/a EINECS No.: 284-293-2 JECFA No.: n/a

Description: The various species of aloe are plants with stalks about 1 m in height, few
branches, and succulent basal leaves that are quite elongated and spiny-toothed; the ﬂowers
are spicated. The plant is native to southern Africa. The useful product is the juice, extracted
by cutting the succulent leaves when turgid; the juice is subsequently concentrated and dried.
Technically and commercially dried aloe juices are distinguished by their characteristic
cleavage (glassy or waxy) (Burdock, 1997).

Aloe extract derived from the concentrated juice from the leaves of the plant has
a very bitter characteristic ﬂavor. Extracts and tinctures are sometimes used in liquor formu-
lations because of the bitter ﬂavor.
Derivatives: Aloe derivatives include ﬂuid extract, dry and soft extracts and tincture (10% in
80% ethanol). The main constituent of the juice and its derivatives is aloin, which varies from
5 to 25%.

Physical—chemical characteristics: The oil is a mobile, pale-yellow liquid exhibiting a

mercial use as a ﬂavor ingredient (Burdock, 1997). Other characteristics include: Speciﬁc
gravity: 0.863; Boiling point: 266 to 271°C.
Essential oil composition: Aloe juice contains about 2% essential oil. The main constituent
of the juice and its derivatives (ﬂuid extract, dry and soft extracts and tincture) is aloin.

Description: Ambergris, also called ambra, is the pathological tissue resulting from the con-
sumption of indigestible components by whales. It accumulates in the intestinal tract of the
sperm or cachalot whale. It may become dislodged from the intestinal tract and is occasion-
ally washed ashore (Somaliland, Mozambique, Java, Japan and Madagascar); more oﬁen it is
found in whales taken in commercial hunts. Tissue ranges from 50 to 150 g in weight,
although occasionally much larger pieces are found. Ambergris usually is distinguished com-
mercially in four different qualities, depending on the color and physical appearance (i.e., as
soft black amber, waxy ash-gray amber, gray amber or white amber). The latter two qualities
are the most valued. The quality of ambergris may improve on aging and particularly when
exposed to daylight and saltwater.

Ambergris tincture has a peculiar, sweet, extremely tenacious odor with a sea-
weed, moss-like undertone. Although ambergris is used mainly in perfumery, the tincture
may be employed in the formulation of aromas to confer special bouquets to liqueurs,
tobacco, fruit ﬂavors and beverages, candy and ice cream ﬂavors.

Derivatives: Dried or powdered ambra is never used as such. Usually it is used as a tincture
(3 to 5% in 90 to 95% ethanol), extract or resinoid (prepared by concentration of the tincture).
The alcoholic extract is aged in tightly sealed bottles in darkness to allow the full develop-
ment of odor.

Description: The plant, originally from eastern India, is now cultivated in several tropical
and equatorial countries. The fruits of the cultivated plant, Hibiscus abelmoschus L., contain
the ﬂat, kidney-shaped seeds about 4 mm long and 3 mm thick. The seeds are grayish-red but
sometimes greenish in color. Although the better quality seeds are said to come from Martin-
ique, seeds are also produced in Angola, Ecuador, China, Indonesia, Madagascar and the
Seychelles.

Description: The raw essence is derived from the steam distillation of whole or crushed
ambrette seeds, with use of the latter providing a higher quantity of palmitic acid in the distil-
late. Removal of the fatty acid by alcohol extraction or precipitation by divalent salts pro-
duces the liquid essential oil. The essential oil is a clear, yellow to amber-colored liquid with
a characteristic aromatic ﬂavor, and a distinctly brandy-like and ﬂoral, musky odor. Adultera-
tion with ambrettolide, famesol or other macrocyclic lactones has occurred. The main constit-
uents of the oil include famesol and ambrettolide.

Speciﬁcations: There are two essential oils: raw essence and liquid. The raw essence is
obtained by steam distillation of seeds. lt solidiﬁes at 35 to 39°C because it contains large
amounts of fatty acids (primarily palmitic). The liquid essential oil is obtained by removing
the fatty acid from the raw essence by solvent extraction (alcohol) or precipitation of the fatty
acids as the calcium or magnesium salts. The essential oil has the following characteristics:

ANGELICA

Botanical name: Angelica archangelica L.
Botanical family: Umbelliferae

90 Fenaroli’s Handbook of Flavor Ingredients

Other names: Garden angelica, European angelica

Foreign names: Archangelique (Fr.), Echt Engelwurz (Gen), Arcangelica (Sp.), Angelica
(IL)

Description: Angelica is an herbaceous plant, about 1.5 m high, cultivated in Europe, espe-
cially France, Belgium and Germany. The plant is characterized by spindle-shaped, ﬂeshy
roots, an erect stalk, alternate leaves and greenish-yellow ﬂowers with an inferior ovary; the
seeds are oblong with an off-white color. The plant blooms from June to August. The parts of
the angelica used are the roots, seeds and stems. The active principles of angelica are con-
marin and furocoumarin. The plant (including roots and seeds) contains several furocou-
marins including angelicin, bergapten and xanthotoxin, as well as umbelliprenin and various
phenols. One of the main constituents is ﬂ-phellandrene.

Angelica may be cultivated as a fresh vegetable, or cooked and prepared like rhu-
barb. The dried roots and the corresponding derivatives ﬁnd extensive use in the formulation
of liqueurs. Roots are often employed in the ﬂavoring of vermouths and bitters. The roots
are sometimes employed with juniper berries to make gin. Angelica oil or extract contains 5-
methoxypsoralen and 8-methoxypsoralen and may therefore evoke photodermatitis. Recur-
rent vesicular dermatitis has been reported among confectioners gathering angelica.
Derivatives: The derivatives are the ﬂuid extract from the roots, tincture (20% root extract
and less often, seed extract in 60% ethanol), essential root oil, essential seed oil and essential
stem oil.

Derivative names: Angelica seed oil, Angela root oil, Angelica stem oil, Angelica root
extract

Essential oil composition: The main components in the essential oil obtained from various
parts of Angelica archangelica of Romanian origin: Root oil: a-pinene 27%, B-pinene
57.1%; Stem oil: caryophyllene 49.2%; Leaf oil: (x-pinene 36.9%, B-pinene 23.9%, B-phel-
landrene 33.8%; Flower oil: B-phellandrene 68.3%; Fruit oil: B—phellandrene 87.4%.

Description: The essential root oil is obtained by steam distillation of the roots. The pale-
yellow to deep-amber liquid has a warm, pungent odor with musky or earthy notes and has a
bittersweet ﬂavor. The yield from the roots is fairly low even though they may be steam dis-
tilled for up to 24 hours; these factors, coupled with the qualitative differences in old vs.
young roots and the labor-intensive process in digging and cleaning the roots, make the root
oil fairly expensive.

ﬁxed oil and 1.5 to 4% of essential oil. Parts used are fruits, improperly called seeds. Anise
has a history of use as a spice and as a fragrance. It has a sweet, soﬁ, mild ﬂavor with rich
effects. The main component responsible for its characteristic taste and smell, as well as for
its medicinal properties, is trans-anethole.

Derivatives: Fluid extract, tincture (20% in approximately 70% ethanol), infusion (5%) and
decoction (4%). Extraction of anise seed yields an oleoresin containing ﬁxed oil and the full
anise ﬂavor.

Essential oil composition: The seeds yield 2.5% of the oil on steam distillation. The major
components of the oil are typically 95% trans-anethole (strong, sweet, anise) and 2% methyl
chavicol (strong, sweet, tarragon). TNO (2000) reported presence of 44 compounds in anise.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

'3 Anise is synonymously used with star anise (lllicium verum Hook,F.), which is described separately in this book.
FCC (1996) has described both anise oil and star anise oil under the title “Anise Oil.”

Description: This small tree bears panicles of white or pink ﬂowers similar to wild roses, and
a hairy, reddish fruit capsule containing 30 to 50 seeds. It is very popular with bees. Annatto
colors are obtained from the seeds. The pericarb of the seed contains a coloring material,
which is obtained by extraction. The red seed coats (arils) are also scraped ol‘i~ for use as an
orange-red dye. The dye colors cheese, butter and chocolate and is used locally to ﬂavor rice.

APRICOT

Botanical name: Prunus armeniaca L.

Botanical family: Rosaceae

Description: There are many varieties and species of apricot, differing in ﬂavor, color and
size. Trees of this genus have attractive ﬂowers and bark, and bear ﬁnely toothed, deciduous
leaves and various single-stoned fruits. The 10 m Prunus armem'aca tree is drought resistant
with red shoots, a stone fruit (drupe); a one-seeded fruit that does not split open itself; and
with the seed is enclosed a stony endocarp, called the pit. Part used is the kernel of the pit.
Fruits vary in colors from yellows and oranges to deep purples. In India and China, the apri-
cot has been used for over 2000 years. Excessive ingestion of apricot kernels causes cyanide
poisoning in both animals and humans. Prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide) present in kernels
has been used in Chinese medicine.

Constituents: Acids present in apricot fruits include malic, citric, tartaric, quinic, succinic,
acetic, caﬁ‘eic, p-coumaric and ferulic. The cyanogenic glycoside amygdalin has been deter-
mined from the seeds. Sugars present in apricot include xylose, glucose, fructose and sorbi-
tol. TNO (2000) reported the presence of 216 compounds in apricot; of these, 22 are
hydrocarbons, 31 alcohols, 20 carbonyl aldehydes, 23 carbonyl ketones, 16 acids, 76 esters,
11 lactones and remaining bases, sulfur compounds, ethers, phenols, furans and (ep)oxides
pyrans or coumarins.

Synthesis: Enzymatically, arginine is formed in two reactions from citrulline. The ﬁrst reac-
tion (citrulline + succinate) is catalyzed by the enzyme arginosuccinate synthetase. It is ATP
dependent and with the formation of a new C-N bond in the gaunidino group of arginosucci-
nate, water is removed and ATP is hydrolyzed. The second reaction is catalyzed by arginine
synthetase and involves the scission of arginosuccinate with the formation of arginine and
fumaric acid.

CAS No.: 977000-27-3 FL No.: n/a FEMA No.: n/a NAS No.:
_CoE No.: n/a EINECS No.: n/a JECFA No.: n/a

Description: Perennial herb commonly growing in pastures and mountain areas. A. montana
grows wild in Russia, Scandinavia, northern India, and central and northern Europe. A cordi-
folia grows wild in the US, where it is known as mountain tobacco. The plant is 20 to 60 cm
tall and has cylindrical rhizomes sprouted with numerous smaller roots, leaves, terminal soli-
tary buds and peripheral ligulate yellow ﬂowers (June to July). The ﬂowers (also rhizomes)
are used. lntemal and external preparations made from the ﬂowering heads of arnica have
been used medicinally for hundreds of years. Arnica has an agreeable, herbaceous, sweet
odor, somewhat reminiscent of chamomile, with a slight bitter ﬂavor.

Derivatives: Absolute, infusion (0.5 to 1.0%) tincture, ﬂuid extract and resinoid (resinoine).
An aromatic principle of the absolute is thymohydroquinone dimethylether.

Physical—chemical characteristics: Arnica oil is yellow-orange to green-blue; it is obtained
by steam distillation of ﬂowers. Amica root oil is obtained from the rhizomes; it is yellow to
dark-yellow and more viscous than arnica oil. Both oils are scarce and expensive. Presumably
some of the aromatic principles of the plant are lost in making the essential oil, and for this
reason, the absolute, tincture and resinoid are preferred.

Composition: A number of ﬂavonoid glycosides have been identiﬁed in arnica. Besides
these ﬂavonoids, terpenoids, amines, carbohydrates and volatile oils have been detected.
Other components found in arnica include bitter compound amicin, caffeic acid, carotenoids,
phytosterols, resin, tannins and anthoxanthine.

Description: Perennial, herbaceous plant of Mediterranean origin, it can grow taller than 1
m. it has rhizomes, an erect stalk, large alternate leaves, blue-violet ﬂowers and enveloping
ﬂeshy bracts. Parts used are cauline leaves. The leaves have a bitter tonic ﬂavor. The ﬂeshy
receptacles and bracts of the ﬂower bud and blanched stalk are eaten as a vegetable, but they
may cause off-ﬂavors in breast milk. The artichoke has been popular since Roman times as a
food and medicine. Much of the pharmacologic activity of the leaves has been attributed to
the presence of caffeoquuinic acid derivatives.

Derivatives: Decoction (5%), ﬂuid extract (soft and dried), tincture (20% in 60% ethanol).

Description: Ascorbic acid is present in nutritionally useful amounts in many edible plants,
especially in rapidly growing leafy vegetables, fruits, tomatoes and potatoes. Foods of animal
origin as usually consumed are generally poor sources of the vitamin. Of the stereoisomers
(L—ascorbic acid, D-ascorbic acid, L-isoascorbic acid and D-isoascorbic acid or erythorbic
acid), only L-ascorbic acid has signiﬁcant vitamin C activity. The vitamin C activity of ascor-
byl palmitate is approximately equal to that of L-ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid has a pleasant,
sharp, acidic taste without any odor. It is extensively used as antioxidant, meat-curing aid,
nutrient and dietary supplement. For a detailed description see Burdock (1997).

Synthesis: Ascorbic acid is prepared synthetically or extracted from various vegetable
sources in which it occurs naturally. Synthesis involves the hydrogenation of D-glucose to D-
sorbitol, followed by oxidation of the diacetone derivative of L-sorbose and the resulting
diacetone-Z-keto-l-gulonic acid converted to L-ascorbic acid by heating with hydrochloric
acid.

Description: Aspartame has no odor, but has an intense sweet taste. it is a high intensity
sweetener, about 160 to 200 times sweeter than sucrose. Normal digestive processes convert
aspartame to phenylalanine, aspartic acid and methanol. Metabolism of aspartame in the
body provides approximately 17 k] (4 kcal)/g. The stability of aspartame is affected by mois-
ture, pH and temperature. For a detailed description of this compound refer to Burdock
(1997).

Description: Basil is an annual herbaceous plant native to Asia and other tropical regions; it
is cultivated as a culinary herb throughout Europe. The plant is 15 to 45 cm tall with an erect
stem, opposite oblique leaves and white or purplish ﬂowers arranged in clusters. The plant
ﬂowers from May to September and has an intense, pleasant, characteristic odor. Owing to
widespread hybridation, several varieties of plants are known as basil, each yielding on distil-
lation essential oil of different aromatic character. Sweet basil has a warm, intense, spicy
aroma with fresh, mint-like ﬂavor; it can have a camphor-like note.

Derivatives: The derivatives are infusion (3%), tincture (20% in 60% ethanol), essential oils.

duced in the Comoros Islands, (2) the Mediterranean type or true sweet basil, (3) the Bulgar-
ian or methylcinnamate types, and (4) the phenolic type from the java. The Reunion and
Mediterranean type are discussed under Derivatives. The phenolic type of basil (Ocimum
gratissimum) is readily distinguished from true sweet basil by the presence of approximately
60% eugenol and some thymol in the essential oil.

Composition: The constituents are reported to include methyl cinnamate (35.16 to 84.53%),
linalool (4.3 to 47.39%) and methyl chavicol (8.92%), depending upon the particular variety.
TNO (2000) reported presence of 194 compounds in Ocimum basilicum varieties. Of these,
82 were hydrocarbons, 46 alcohols and the remaining were carbonyl aldehydes, carbonyl
ketones, esters, ethers, phenols, furans and oxides of pyrans and coumarins.

C015 No.: n/a EINECS No.: 232-383-7 JECFA No.: n/a

Description: Crude yellow beeswax is harvested together with honey and represents a sec-
ondary secretion of the bee. Once the honey is recovered from the honeycomb by draining
the cells, the wax combs are washed with water, melted and poured into molds to harden. The
wax is reﬁned by melting in hot water to which sulfuric acid or alkali may be added to extract
impurities. The resulting wax is referred to as yellow beeswax. Yellow beeswax contains
cerolein, a mixture of fatty acids and soluble in hot alcohol and slightly soluble in cold alco-
hol; myricyl alcohol and myricyl palmitate, insoluble in alcohol. Beeswax is produced world-
wide with the same chemical composition. The odor may vary slightly, depending on the
source.

Derivatives: Beeswax absolute, prepared by alcoholic extraction of the raw wax, is a waxy
solid having a light-yellow color and a very mild, sweet odor with a waxy undertone.

Description: Benzoic acid is almost odorless or exhibits a faint balsamic odor and a sweet-
sour to acrid taste. Sodium benzoate as an article of commerce is in the form of a white pow-
der or ﬂakes. It can be mixed dry into bulk liquids and dissolves promptly. The pH range for
optimum microbial inhibition by benzoic acid is 2.5 to 4.0, which is lower than that of sorbic
acid or propionic acid. Thus, benzoates are well adapted for the preservation of food, which
are acid, or readily acidiﬁed such as carbonated beverages, fruit juices, cider, pickles and
sauerkraut.

Description: Trees of this species are about 15 m tall. Resin ﬂows from the incision made in
the bark. S. tonkinensis (Siam benzoin) grows extensively in Laos and Tonkin. S. benzoin
Dryand. (Sumatra benzoin) grows in Sumatra and Malaya. Sumatra benzoin is produced
commercially in two basic qualities: selected tears and almonds or amygdaloid forms. The
size of the tear-shaped pieces allows a further classiﬁcation into three or four types. The
amount of granules (almonds) as compared to the mass allows a classiﬁcation into three basic
qualities. The resins are the parts used. Benzoin has a sweet, balsamic, pleasant odor and an
aromatic, acrid, bittersweet taste.

Derivatives: Tinctures of various percentages in 95% ethanol, ﬂuid extract, and resinoids.
The chemical differences between Siam and Sumatra varieties derive from the levels of cin-
namic and benzoic acids and their corresponding esters; benzoic derivatives prevail in Siam
benzoin, while cinnamic derivatives prevail in Sumatra benzoin. Siam benzoin is used in
preference to Sumatra benzoin for food ﬂavoring, but must be ﬁrst de-acidiﬁed.

BERGAMOT

Botanical name: Citrus bergamia Risso, C. aurantium L.

Botanical family: Rutaceae

Other names: Bergamot orange; Citrus bergamia (Risso & Poiteau)

Foreign names: Bergamotier (Fr.), Bergamot (Gen), Bergamota (Sp.), Bergamotto ( It.)
Description: The bergamot is a small, delicate tree similar to other citrus plants, such as
orange and lemon. The plant ﬂowers twice a year in the spring and the end of summer, and
yields orange-like fruits, only smaller in size. The peel of the fresh, nearly ripe fruit is the
source of bergamot oil; also used are the fruit, rind, leaf and twig. Although the bergamot
plant is native to Asia, it is cultivated extensively in Calabria, Italy. A few experimental culti-
vations in the Mediterranean basin and on the Atlantic coast of equatorial Africa have attained
only a limited success. Bergamot oil is a widely used material that imparts a citrus ﬂavor to
foods and beverages. Bergamot has a ﬂagrant, sweet, fruit odor.

Description: A volatile oil obtained by expression, without the aid of heat from the fresh peel
of the fruit of Citrus bergamia Risso & Poiteau. One of the constituents of bergamot, ber-
gaptene, is a skin sensitizer and some bergamot oil is distilled to produce oils free from ber-
gaptene and terpenes. The major use of bergamot oil is in “Earl Grey” type tea ﬂavor, where
it is normally the major component.

Physical-chemical characteristics: It is a clear, mobile, yellowish-green liquid with a fra-
grant, sweet fruity odor. It is miscible with alcohol and glacial acetic acid. It is soluble in
most ﬁxed oils, but is insoluble in glycerin and in propylene glycol. It may contain a suitable
antioxidant. Bergamot essential oil yields a concentrated oil by distillation under reduced
pressure. Also, terpeneless and sesquiterpeneless oils can be prepared from bergamot essen-
tial oil. A petitgrain bergamot is also manufactured by steam distillation of the leaves and
tw1gs.

Essential oil composition: Bergamot oil is a complex mixture of more than 300 compounds.
The most revalent compounds are linalyl acetate (30 to 60%), linalool (11 to 22%) and other
alcohols.l Furocoumarins include bergapten (approximately 0.4%), bergamottin, citropten
and others. Rectiﬁed bergamot oil contains lower concentrations of terpenes and has no cou-
manns.

Foreign names: Bois de rose (Fr.), Rosenholz (Gen), Bois de rose (Sp.), Lengo di rosa (lt.)
Description: Evergreen, medium-sized tree growing wild in the forests of the Amazon basin
(Brazil, Peru) and in French Guinea. Brazilian and Peruvian bois-de-rose oils are distilled
from the same botanical variety (A. rosaeodora var. amazonica Ducke.). The oils exhibit
only slightly different physical characteristics, but they have different odors particular to the
growing site of the trees. Cayenne bois-de-rose oil, distilled from the variety A. rosaeodora
Ducke., is considered the best quality of bios-de-rose essential oils. Cayenne bois-de-rose oil
is produced in large scale as compared to the Brazilian and Peruvian counterparts. Plant part
used is the wood. Bois de rose has a characteristic, sweet, somewhat woody, ﬂoral odor.

Description: Boldo is a small wild tree or shrub that is widespread throughout Chile, Bolivia
and Peru. It is also cultivated in Italy. It has slender branches, opposite, short, petioled, coarse
leaves exhibiting a characteristic, pleasant odor reminiscent of Melissa and coriander. The
plant ﬂowers in winter and spring. Parts used are the leaves, which are harvested in autumn.
Boldo has a spicy, hydrocarbon-like odor and an aromatic, burning taste. The essential oil is
obtained by steam distillation of dried leaves, which yields approximately 1.8 to 2.6% oil.
Boldo extract has been used as a ﬂavor in alcoholic beverages. Boldo leaves have been used
by South American natives against diseases of the liver and for the treatment of gallstones.
Derivatives: The derivatives are ﬂuid-extract and tincture (20% in 70% ethanol).

Synthesis: I-Bomyl acetate occurs naturally in many oils distilled from the leaves of plants of
the family Pinaceae; d-bomyl acetate is found in the oils distilled ﬁom plants of the family
Cupressaceae; bomyl acetate therefore may be isolated by distillation and crystallization
from these; however, it is commonly prepared by direct acetylation of bomeol; the ﬁrst syn-
thesis dates to 1889.

been identiﬁed in the essence from ﬂowers of Chrysanthemum sincuse Sabin, in the distillate
of Teucrium chamaedris L., and in the fresh rhizomes of Valeriana oﬂicinalis L; d-bornyl ace-
tate is found in the essential oils of Callitris glauca, C. robusta, C. gracilis, C. vermcosa and
C. calcarata; the presence of acetate has been excluded from the essence of lavender and
lavandin.

Description: This annual has bright-green leaves that are ﬁnely divided, curled and branched
and ﬂowering stems 40 to 50 cm tall. The sweet-scented leaves are used like parsley for ﬂa-
voring soups and stews. The plant is grown in mountain areas of southern Europe and in
England. It is also grown commercially in the U.S. It contains an essential oil and a ﬁxed oil.
Chervil is parsley-like, but more aromatic and reminiscent of tarragon (methyl chavicol) and
has a tonic, aromatic, aperitive taste. The active principle in chervil is estragole.

Description: C. dentata (American chestnut) is the variety of C. vulgaris or sativa (maroon)
and other Castanea species. C. crenata, the Japanese species, differs in having large fruits.
The plant, native to Asia Minor, is widespread in Europe, Asia and North America. American
chestnut has been largely exterminated by blight (a fungus imported from Europe). The
American chestnut was cultivated in 1800 and was once considered to be the queen of the
eastern American forest. With massive, wide-spreading branches and a deep, broad-rounded
crown, the American chestnut was known to reach a height of 30 m. It was commonly found
on mountains, hills and slopes in gravelly or rocky, well-drained glacial soils. The parts used
are nutmeat and leaves. Chestnut has an astringent, tonic taste.

Note: The sweet chestnut (C. sativa) and other Castanea species are derived from a genus
separate from the horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum). Chestnut of the genus Aesculus

is considered toxic.

Description: American chestnut leaves were traditionally used as a ﬂavoring ingredient, but a
fungal disease introduced into North America decimated the American chestnut population
over the past 50 to 60 years. Mediterranean varieties of chestnut, including C. sativa Mill.

used, although much is imported from Hungary and the former Yugoslavia. The leaves of C.

sativa Mill. are gathered during the months of September and October. Extracts of chestnut

leaves have a strong, astringent effect and are used only sparingly as a ﬂavoring ingredient.

Probably a greater use is as an antitussive and expectorant in folk medicine.
